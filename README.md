## Snake Game
Objective: Navigate around the map and collect apples to boost your score. Each apple collected elongates the snake by one (1) unit.

Control the snake's movement using arrow keys or WASD keys.

The game will be over once the snake hits a wall or its own tail.

Press ENTER to restart.

## FAQ (in advance)
### Why does it sometimes GameOver when I press multiple keys near-simultaneously?
Self-collision detects overlap between the snake's head and body. Apparently this happens momentarily, sometimes, when attempting to navigate quickly and rapidly.
